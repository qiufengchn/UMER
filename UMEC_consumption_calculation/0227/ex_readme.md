## Extended Content from Image
- **Correlation between Urban Form and Energy Consumption**:
  - **Spatial Distribution**: Urban form characteristics such as compactness, density, and mixed-use patterns affect the spatial distribution of energy consumption.
  - **Temporal Dynamics**: Changes in urban form over time affect energy consumption, with compact and mixed-use development typically reducing energy consumption.
- **Building Energy Consumption**:
  - **Orientation**: Buildings facing south capture more solar energy, which reduces heating demand.
  - **Height**: Taller buildings have higher heating and cooling needs due to reduced wind and sunlight.
  - **Compact**: More compact buildings have lower surface area to volume ratios, resulting in less energy loss.
  - **Green**: Green space improves insulation and shading, reducing energy consumption.
